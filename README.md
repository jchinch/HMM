# HMM
Implemented Hidden Markov Model to solve three main problems related to HMMs. The three problems are as following. 
1 - Given a known model what is the likelihood of sequence O happening?
2 - Given a known model and sequence O, what is the optimal hidden state sequence? 
3 - Given sequence O and number of hidden states, what is the optimal model which maximizes the probability of O?
4(extra) - Given just output states and the observation set O calculated optimal number of hidden states for HMM using AIC, BIC and log-liklihood criteria.
